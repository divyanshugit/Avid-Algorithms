# Support Vector Machines

<p>
A <strong>support vector machine(SVM)</strong> is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category, they’re able to categorize new text.

Compared to newer algorithms like neural networks, they have two main advantages: higher speed and better performance with a limited number of samples (in the thousands). This makes the algorithm very suitable for text classification problems, where it’s common to have access to a dataset of at most a couple of thousands of tagged samples.

A support vector machine takes these data points and outputs the hyperplane (which in two dimensions it’s simply a line) that best separates the tags. This line is the decision boundary and different kernels or filters are used for different data characteristics.</p>
