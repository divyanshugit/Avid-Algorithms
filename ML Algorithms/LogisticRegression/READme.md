# Lgistic Regression:
We need some pre-required knowledge to understand this notebook.
-   1. Basic Matrix Manupulation.
-   2. Calculas/Derivation.
-   3. Basic unserstanding about Logistic regression.

**Logistic Regression:**<br/>
Logistic regression is a non-linear classification algorithm. Some of the examples of classification problems are Email spam or not spam, Online transactions Fraud or not Fraud, Tumor Malignant or Benign. Logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value. <br/>

**Notes/Reference:**
-   1. Followed this book for derivation ---> [PDF](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes2020spring/cs229-notes1.pdf)
-   2. Added my notes in this folder( may or may not useful to you, but it has the detailed derivation of cost function, this is hard to find in online) you can use this, if you want :)
